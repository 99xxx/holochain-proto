### Contributor Guidelines

#### Tech

* We use test driven development.  Adding a new function or feature, should mean you've added a new test!

#### Social

* Protocols for Inclusion.

We recognize the need to actively foster vibrant thriving community, which means among other things, building a culture that breaks cycles of marginalization and dominance behavior.  To that end many open source communities adopt Codes of Conduct like [this one](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/).  We are in the process of addressing the goals of such codes in what we feel is a more general way, by establishing meta requirements for each membrane within our social organism to describe its <i>Protocols for Inclusion</i>.  Until we have done so please operate using the above referenced code as a general protocol for inclusion.
